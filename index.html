    <h1>Happy Birthday.</h1>
    <p>I learned HTML for you.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Okay, not really. Grant helped.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>But it was my idea.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>He said I could do colors. That it wasn't that complicated.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">OOOH LOOK COLORS!</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>...okay full disclosure I copy and pasted that from a website. I don't know what any of this means.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p style="color:sienna;"> Look more colors!</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Gosh this is a lot of work...</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I knew there was a reason I didn't go into computer science.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This is taking a lot of mental energy that I just don't feel like expending on NOT your brithday.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Anyway, I kind of learned HTML for you. Happy Birthday.</p>
